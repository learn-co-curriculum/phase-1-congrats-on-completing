# Congratulations on Completing Phase 1!

Congratulations on finishing the first phase of Flatiron School's Software
Engineering Program! You should now be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of JavaScript as a language, including functions and scope
- Use different data types and structures to solve problems in JavaScript
- Identify and resolve bugs in code
- Manipulate web pages in response to user actions using the DOM
- Use asynchronous JavaScript to retrieve data and communicate with the server

By gaining proficiency in your first programming language, you'll have a much
easier time mastering the more advanced features of the language and using
libraries to build more complex projects.
